### About Oracle Digital Assistant
  
Oracle Digital Assistant delivers a complete AI platform to create conversational experiences for business applications through text, chat, and voice interfaces.

### Conversational AI

Natural language understanding and machine learning
Oracle Digital Assistant applies deep semantic parsing using natural language processing, natural language understanding (NLU), and custom algorithms to understand common conversations to derive accurate intent and context.

### AI-powered voice

Eliminate reliance on third-party offerings with Oracleâ€™s AI-powered voice. Users can communicate with their business application using voice commands with an assistant that understands their business-specific vocabulary and enables naturally expressive interactions. Give your customers more control of their data by providing end-to-end security and compliance with privacy standards, such as PII and GDPR.

### Analytics and insights

Gain customer insights through built-in analytics that identify conversational bottlenecks and usage patterns and make data-driven decisions that continually improve the user experience.

### SQL Dialog Skills 

SQL Dialogs are skills that can translate a user's natural language utterances into SQL queries, send the queries to a backend data source, and display the response. This version of SQL Dialogs supports integration with Oracle database services, such as Oracle Enterprise Database Service.

When writing skills that provide database information to end users, developers typically need to define the use cases, write custom components to retrieve the data, create intents for the use cases, map user utterances to intents, and write the dialog flow to handle every intent. With SQL Dialog skills, you don't need to do these steps. Instead, you map the users' mental models of the data to the physical data source, and the skill uses the map to dynamically generate SQL from natural language utterances.

For example, users might know that employees belong to departments that are in various locations, for example users can ask "How many transactions were approved" , "list the customer names whose transactions have been rejected" etc


## Task 1: Log into OCI

1. Login into OCI

    To setup environment, you need OCI administrator's privileges. If you've got these privileges, login into OCI at [cloud.oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/sign-in.html). the below image indicates SSO Login as an administrative user. If you have administrative previleges and complete access over a tenancy then you need not create any of the policies below steps.

    </copy>
    ``` 
  ![ODA provisioned status](./images/test-model-4.png " ")

## Task 8: Review the SQL Generated

For every chatbot response, there will be an SQL Dialog where you can verify the OMRQL and corresponding SQL. 

1. The same queries can be tuned or changed if required while training the bot for more accuracy.
 
  ![ODA provisioned status](./images/test-model-5.png " ")

    ```
    <copy>
    Chatbot User: List the transaction by Jeremy Robertson.
    </copy>
    ``` 

  ![ODA provisioned status](./images/test-model-7.png " ")

2. Review the Conversation auto generated.
   
  ![ODA provisioned status](./images/test-model-6.png " ")
  
## Task 9: Create a web channel for our Skill.

Under left navigation -> Development -> Channels -> Add Channel and create Oracle Web channel. 

1. We would need this channel ID and Digital Assistant website URL later.
   ![ODA provisioned status](./images/web-channel.png " ")
   Optionally, you can turn off client authentication.

## Task 10: Configure chatbot SDK Javascript file

1. Configure chatbot SDK Javascript file

  [Download web client SDK](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/digital-assistant/sdks.html). Extract on your local system. Update settings.js and change the URI (matching the Digital Assistant URL on the web browser and channel ID; the user ID can be left blank.
  ![ODA provisioned status](./images/sdk-code.png " ")
    
2. Run the web client

  We can now run the index.html web page as a stand-alone or Live Server of Visual Studio code. from here, we are all set to put the chatbot on any static website. CSS can be customised as required. all it needs is the following lines of HTML code

    ```
    <copy>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles/redwood-base.css">
    <script src="scripts/settings.js" defer></script>
    <script src="scripts/web-sdk.js" onload="initSdk('Bots')" defer></script>
    </copy>
    ``` 
    ![ODA provisioned status](./images/chatbot-page.png " ")

## Task 11: Run chatbot on Oracle APEX page

1. If you plan to run this chatbot on your APEX application, upload the settings.js, web-sdk.js and redwood-base.css into APEX application folder under shared components -> Static Application Files.

2. Create APEX page and just create a static html region with following code, change the path if required.
    ```
      <copy>
        <html lang="en-US" class="no-js" >
        <head>
            <script src="#APP_FILES#oda/settings#MIN#.js"></script>
            <script src="#APP_FILES#oda/web-sdk.js" onload="initSdk('Bots')"></script>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="#APP_FILES#oda/redwood-base.css" >  
        </head>
        </html>
      </copy>
      ``` 
      ![ODA provisioned status](./images/chatbot-page-2.png " ")
      ```
      <copy>
      Chatbot User: what is the total sum value of all transactions
      </copy>
      ``` 
      ![ODA provisioned status](./images/chatbot-page-3.png " ")
    
 
You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
