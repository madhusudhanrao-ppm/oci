# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Real-time Financial Services Transaction Monitoring

In the financial services banking sector, money transfer transactions run over millions in a given second, and there are multiple modes of money transfer over the Internet from person to person and bank to bank. It can be via debit cards, credit cards, internet banking, unified payment interface, etc.

Fraud prevention plays a significant role in fraud detection. For example, the transaction monitoring system will approve genuine transactions, reject fraudulent transactions, or on-hold those in question based on multiple business rules, such as transaction amount, location of customer and merchant, purchase category, the time between two consecutive transactions (frequency), etc. By detecting transactional fraud, intelligent systems can prevent recurring fraud by temporarily blocking cards or payment interfaces. 

The on-hold transactions can undergo a human review and approval process. Reviewers can also take action on suspected transactions using customer profile document verifications or previous transaction history.

This workshop covers financial services use cases, such as fraud detection, money laundering, and money mules in the system on a simulated real-time transaction dashboard.
