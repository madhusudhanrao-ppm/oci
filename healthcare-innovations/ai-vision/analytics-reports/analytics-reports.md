# Oracle Analytics Cloud for Clinical Data Analysis

## Introduction

This workshop walks you through the steps of creating an Oracle Analytics cloud instance, creating Analytics reports or Data Visualization and making these reports available in Oracle APEX Application. We will take the example of Analysing Clinical Data, but there are limitless opportunities to Analyse Healthcare Data using Oracle Analytics cloud.
 
### About Analytics Platform

The Oracle Analytics platform is a cloud native service that provides the capabilities required to address the entire analytics process including data ingestion and modeling, data preparation and enrichment, and visualization and collaboration, without compromising security and governance. Embedded machine learning and natural language processing technologies help increase productivity and build an analytics-driven culture in organizations. Start on-premises or in the cloudâ€”Oracle Analytics supports a hybrid deployment strategy, providing flexible paths to the cloud.
  
Estimated Time: 60 minutes.

<copy>
    <div style="width:100%;height:1200px" >
    <oracle-dv 
    project-path="/@Catalog/users/username/foldername/Clinical-Dataset-Workbook" >
    </oracle-dv>
    </div>
</copy>
```
