## About this workshop

This workshop showcases a 360-degree view of UNESCO heritage sites to Travelers. Visualize how it feels to be there in that place now. They can also ask Travel expert guide questions related to that UNESCO heritage site, such as its History, activities around it or places for shopping. This also helps to find the nearest accommodations available or look out for other nearby UNESCO sites and Airports. 

Travelers can also plan for an Airbnb accommodation within their budget and nearby, preview it inside and get a street view. Ask for the activities around that place.
 
Once the Travel plan is made, find the low-fare plane tickets from their location to the UNESCO site and plan their return journey.
